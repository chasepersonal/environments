# Raspberry Pi 4

The files in this directory will contain steps to provision a new Rapsberry Pi cluster.

Though the focus will be to prepare it to be a k3s cluster, the steps in this directory are more generic and can be applied to Raspberry Pi builds that aren't k3s related.

The purpose of this directory is to house Ansible playbooks that will help automate the provisiong on a Raspberry Pi cluster and ensure that the cluster is as homogoneous with it's packages and storage layout as much as possible.
